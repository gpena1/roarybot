# Bot Summary
Right now, the only usable features are the weather commands and the parking availability commands. Any parts of the code not pertaining to either are currently unused, and are byproducts of messing around with discord.py to get a feel for it.

# Will I add other features?
At the moment, no. If you want to see something added, though, you're welcome to make pull requests.
